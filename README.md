# ML-model-creation-and-testing-on-Postman


â€¢	In this code  I have included EDA like data cleaning, feature selection, feature transformation. Once the model is built create an API which takes the input and do the prediction. API can be tested on Postman. Take the data from Open Source. Add at least one deep learning algorithm in any of the above modelling.
